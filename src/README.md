## Put cocotb tests here

Do not place any Verilog files here and do not edit the Makefile, or you may break things in the actions pipeline.

Do not edit `top_template.v` unless you know what youâ€™re doing.

It is still recommended to write tests for gate-level verification even when using Logisim Evolution.
