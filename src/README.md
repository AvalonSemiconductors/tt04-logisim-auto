## Put cocotb tests here

Do not place any Verilog files here and do not edit the Makefile, or you may break things in the actions pipeline.

Do not edit `top_template.v` unless you know what youâ€™re doing.

The file `top.v` and everything in the `logisim` directory are auto-generated by the Logisim-to-GDS flow, and will be overwriten on each run of the GDS pipeline. Do not edit them.

It is still recommended to write tests for gate-level verification even when using Logisim Evolution.
